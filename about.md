I am a full time Software Engineer based in London as part of the Capgemini Big Data team, and I am also on the Capgemini Degree Apprenticeship program. I have had the opportunity to work with a variety of big data technologies for a large public sector client. Recently, I have spent time building REST APIs with Spring Boot and Java 8 to retrieve data from HBase for use as part of a real time risking process using Drools. 

In my own time I love to tinker with Python, especially with Flask to build REST microservices. I am learning React and hope to release my own SaaS product in the future. Recently I have become interested in Serverless deployment patterns and have been building highly available microservices using AWS Lambda, API Gatewawy, Dynamo DB, Flask, Python 3 and Zappa.
