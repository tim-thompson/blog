title: How I Made This Blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages
---

I have built my fair share of Wordpress sites over the last few years. Despite services like Digital Ocean making setup a breeze, I find Wordpress to be clunky and unintuitive. For a CMS focussed on content creation/blogging I am astounded by how flaky the editor is. So I couldn't bring myself to use Wordpress for my own simple dev blog. Instead I settled on using Jekyll with GitHub Pages to hack together something simple, fast and free that suits my needs perfectly. And so far I love it!
