I am only productive when I am doing something that I want to do. Unfortunately life is full of things that I don't want to do, but I still have to do them. I am very much a culprit of leaving these kinds of tasks to the very last minute. At which point I either realise that it wasn't so bad, or that I should have started it sooner. Either way I usually end up wasting time.

I hate the feeling of unfinished tasks hanging over me. However, this is not enough to make me want to finish something when I could be working on a cool new coding project, or getting more moons in Mario Odyssey. So going into 2018 I decided that I wanted to find a system that worked for me.

Since my career began 3 years ago, I have tried many different methods of organisation, but I have never found one that I can stick to. I think this is partly due to the enforcement of somebody else's system which is why, for the most part, I despise organisation apps. I tried to run my life from the likes of Trello and Todoist but that caused more frustration as neither seemed to fit into how I wanted to work.

I also tried offline alternatives such as the Bullet Journal, but my handwriting isn't the best and I did not like the way that it required me to break my time down into months. As I neared the end of a month I had no way to look into the next month without flipping pages and found myself missing the laid out overviews of a traditional calendar. I looked around online for some alternative ways to organise a bullet journal, but the overwhelming focus on beautification rather than organisation meant I found very few viable alternatives that would suit my needs of "quick and ugly".

After moaning about my lack of organisation for a while (or longer) I decided something must be done. So I came up with my own system that is much more adaptable for my own needs, and doesn't put all my organisational eggs into a single basket.

By no means do I recommend this system for anybody else. Sure, parts of it may work for you in the short term, but there is a high chance that something about it will annoy you. So the best thing I can suggest is to figure out what works for you.

Come up with a list of your requirements and then build around that. Work out what limitations you are willing to accept and then work out what software/notebook will fill these needs. For example despite me bashing Trello earlier on, it features heavily in my own system. Rather than organising my entire life with it I use it for what it was built for, awesome lists! I love a good list and Trello lets me have great lists, so it fulfils that specific requirement.

To give you an idea of what I was looking for in my system, here is the list of requirements that I came up with:

* A way to handle long term tasks, events and goals that can be changed easily
* Tasks that can extend between months without needing to copy everything over
* An easy to modify system for handling events that provides nice overviews
* A daily todo list that tracks all tasks for the current day and allows brief note taking
* Space to write a short summary of the days events

Using these requirements I then worked out what the best way to interact with each of these would be. For example where heavy modification is required a digital system is preferable to me scrawling all over a page. But where quick note taking and todos are needed, where I may not always have easy internet/phone access a notebook is perfect.

The system I came up with uses 3 methods of storing information. Firstly I run my own mail server, with this I also host an instance of NextCloud which comes with a dead simple calendar application. This is perfect for my general needs. I work away from home a lot and it's perfect to keep on top of when I'm home, when I'm away, driving lessons, social activities etc. But I use it only for storing event name, date and time. The web app works perfectly for me when I'm on desktop and I currently use Digical on my Oneplus 3T but I'm still evaluating it.

My girlfriend also has an account for this calendar and it is fantastic for keeping track of each other's whereabouts as I'm often away and she often works long or unusual hours when performing.

For storing lists, long term todos and goals I use Trello. I have a personal Trello board that tracks all my long term todos and their due dates. For me this includes personal, university and work. The interactive nature of the Trello cards also allows me to attach files, images, checklists etc which is perfect for more long drawn out tasks.

I also use my trello board for storing other lists such as my goals for 2018, ideas for days out with my girlfriend, a personal wishlist etc. but these see much less use than my long term todo lists.

And finally I use a notebook for my day to day notes and todo lists. I more or less ripped this straight from the daily section of a bullet journal because that part of it worked great for me. I use a page a day so I don't feel like I'm limiting myself and try to write a small summary at the end of every day. I find that for me this helps to keep me focussed and can stop me from bottling things up so that I gain a bit more perspective.
